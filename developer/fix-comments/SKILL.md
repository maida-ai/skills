name: fix-comments
description: GitHub pull request review workflow for stacked or multi-commit PRs, focused on mapping review comments to their atomic commits, preserving commit structure during fixes, maintaining a local review-resolution report, and preparing optional reply drafts. Best fit for PR review follow-up where comments belong in specific commits.

# Fix Comments

Use this skill to address GitHub PR review comments inside the commits where they belong while preserving an atomic commit stack.

## Resources

- `scripts/get-review-comments`: fetch grouped PR review comments as JSON. Resolve this path relative to this skill directory before invoking it.
- `scripts/pr-review-comments.graphql`: GraphQL query used by the helper.
- `scripts/group-by-commit.jq`: jq transformer used by the helper.
- `assets/review-report-template.md`: local report skeleton.
- `assets/reply-template.md`: optional reply patterns.

Do not reimplement the helper scripts unless they fail and the user asks for debugging.

## Safety Invariants

- Require a clean working tree before history rewriting, or ask the user how to preserve dirty work.
- Create a backup branch before rebasing.
- Use one interactive rebase from the PR merge base; do not run independent rebases per commit.
- Never squash, drop, reorder, or push commits unless the user explicitly asks.
- Never run `git add .`, `git add -A`, `git add --all`, `git add -u`, or `git commit -a`.
- Stage only explicit files relevant to the current review comment and current atomic commit.
- Keep `_ai_report/` local and unstaged unless the user asks to include it in the PR.
- Never post GitHub replies automatically; draft optional replies in the report.
- Use editor-safe rebase continuation: `GIT_EDITOR=true git rebase --continue`.

## Workflow

1. Identify `OWNER`, `REPO`, `PR`, `BASE_REF`, and `BASE`.
2. Check `git status --porcelain`; stop on dirty state unless the user directs preservation.
3. Create `BACKUP_BRANCH="backup/pr-${PR}-before-review-fixes-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)"` with `git branch "$BACKUP_BRANCH"`.
4. Extract review comments into `_ai_report/pr-${PR}-comments-$(date +%Y%m%d).json`.
5. Create or update `_ai_report/pr-${PR}-$(date +%Y%m%d).md` from `assets/review-report-template.md`.
6. Stop before rebasing if any actionable comment is unmatched or mapped only by unsafe subject assumptions.
7. Start one interactive rebase from `BASE` and mark only commented commits as `edit`.
8. At each stop, inspect the matching comments, make only commit-local fixes, stage explicit files, amend if needed, and continue with `GIT_EDITOR=true git rebase --continue`.
9. Resolve conflicts conservatively; after staging resolved files, continue with `GIT_EDITOR=true git rebase --continue`.
10. Run relevant validation, then `git range-diff "$BACKUP_BRANCH"...HEAD` and `git log --oneline "$BASE"..HEAD`.
11. Summarize the backup branch, report path, amended commits, validation, rebase status, and that no push was performed.

## Extract Comments

Infer missing PR context when needed:

```bash
OWNER="$(gh repo view --json owner --jq '.owner.login')"
REPO="$(gh repo view --json name --jq '.name')"
PR="$(gh pr view --json number --jq '.number')"
BASE_REF="$(gh pr view "$PR" --repo "$OWNER/$REPO" --json baseRefName --jq '.baseRefName')"
git fetch origin "$BASE_REF"
BASE="$(git merge-base HEAD "origin/$BASE_REF")"
```

Run the helper from the target repository root. Resolve `SKILL_DIR` to this skill's installed directory first, using the skill path provided by the current coding tool.

```bash
SKILL_DIR="${SKILL_DIR:-<path-to-skill>}"
if [ -z "$SKILL_DIR" ]; then
  echo "Set SKILL_DIR to the installed fix-comments skill directory" >&2
  exit 1
fi
mkdir -p _ai_report
COMMENTS_JSON="_ai_report/pr-${PR}-comments-$(date +%Y%m%d).json"
"$SKILL_DIR/scripts/get-review-comments" -o "$OWNER" -r "$REPO" -p "$PR" -u > "$COMMENTS_JSON"
```

The `-u` flag enables subject-based remapping after the helper verifies current PR commit subjects are unique. Without `-u`, comments map by SHA only. If the helper fails, report the command and error and do not start the rebase.

List commented commits:

```bash
jq -r '
  .[]
  | [.commit_order, .short_commit, .subject, .count, (.mapping_reasons | join(","))]
  | @tsv
' "$COMMENTS_JSON"
```

Stop before rebasing if any group has `is_current_commit: false`, `commit_order: 999999`, or `mapping_reasons` containing `unmatched`, unless the user provides a manual mapping.

## Report

Use `assets/review-report-template.md` as the report shape. For every review comment, set exactly one status:

- `resolved`: changed the relevant commit, or verified the code already satisfies the concern.
- `outdated`: the referenced code no longer exists, moved, or was superseded later in the stack.
- `need follow-up`: clarification, product judgment, security/legal review, or design approval is needed.
- `rejected`: intentionally not applied; include a concise technical rationale.

Use `assets/reply-template.md` only when a GitHub reply would be useful. Keep replies optional and do not post them without explicit user instruction.

## Rebase Stops

At each `edit` stop, identify the current commit:

```bash
CURRENT_SHA="$(git rev-parse HEAD)"
CURRENT_SHORT="$(git rev-parse --short HEAD)"
CURRENT_SUBJECT="$(git log -1 --format=%s)"
```

Find matching comments:

```bash
jq --arg sha "$CURRENT_SHA" --arg short "$CURRENT_SHORT" --arg subject "$CURRENT_SUBJECT" '
  .[]
  | select(.commit == $sha or (.short_commit | startswith($short)) or .subject == $subject)
' "$COMMENTS_JSON"
```

For each comment, inspect the referenced file and nearby code before deciding. If code changes are needed, stage explicit pathspecs only:

```bash
git status --short
git add path/to/relevant_file path/to/relevant_test
git diff --cached --name-only
git diff --cached
git commit --amend --no-edit
GIT_EDITOR=true git rebase --continue
```

If no code changes are needed, update only the local report and continue:

```bash
GIT_EDITOR=true git rebase --continue
```

During an `edit` stop, `git add` plus `git rebase --continue` does not include new changes in the stopped commit. Run `git commit --amend --no-edit` before continuing when files changed.

## Conflicts

Resolve conflicts by preserving the intended changes of the commit currently being replayed. Avoid unrelated cleanup. After resolving:

```bash
git add path/to/resolved_file
GIT_EDITOR=true git rebase --continue
```

If unsure, stop. Tell the user they can recover with `git rebase --abort` and that `BACKUP_BRANCH` still points to the pre-rebase state.

## Final Response

Report:

- backup branch name
- report path
- commits amended
- comment counts by status
- validation commands run
- whether the rebase completed
- that no push was performed

Prefer concise, evidence-backed status over a long narrative.
